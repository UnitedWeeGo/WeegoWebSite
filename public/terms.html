		<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any Content hosted on any Service infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing:<br />
		<ul>
		<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
		<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the applicable Weego Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works on the applicable Weego Services;</li>
		<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Weego to locate the material;</li>
		<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Weego to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
		<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (for example, "I am under the good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted content that is identified herein is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."); and</li>
		<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed (for example, "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner, of the copyright(s) that is allegedly infringed by the aforementioned content.").</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Weego's Designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement can be reached as follows: Attention: Copyright Agent at <a href="mailto:copyright@unitedweego.com">copyright@unitedweego.com</a>. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Weego Designated Copyright Agent. Any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support or other communications should be directed to Weego customer service through <a href="mailto:support@unitedweego.com">support@unitedweego.com</a>. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</p>
		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
		<p>The failure of Weego to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
		<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in San Francisco County, California, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. </p>
		<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
		<p>These Terms, the Weego Rules and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Weego and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Weego that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Weego and you regarding the Services.</p>
		<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, and the most current version will always be at <a href="http://unitedweego.com/terms.html" target="_blank">unitedweego.com/terms</a>. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via your Weego client or at the email associated with your account.
